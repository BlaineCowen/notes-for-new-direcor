Pop Show is a big deal at South Houston. 

You can watch our old shows if you look up South Houston High School Trojan Tv and search their channel for Pop Show. I would choreograph the big group songs and the boys songs, and leave the girls songs for some student choreographers. Jeisel and Addison did a good job doing that last year with a little bit of help. And Alex and Camilla should also be good if you encourage them. 

We have always done 1 Thursday Show and 1 Friday show like the second week of May. I charged $5 a ticket using Ludus (plus a $1 processing fee) if they bought online and $7 at the door if they paid cash. 

We had 1 big medley group number with everyone, 2 guys songs, 2 treble songs, 1 Varsity Mixed song, one senior song with a senior slideshow, and we end with a reprise of whatever the last song in the opening medley was. The rest of the time was filled with solos and a short video.
