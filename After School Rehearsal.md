This was the most frustrating part of the job. You have to wait until 3:30 for the Junior and Senior Early College kids to get off the bus and return to school before starting after school rehearsals. For the guys you can start at 3:00 since there should only be 2-3 early college upperclassmen. I also started having rehearsals on Fridays since they don't have college classes on Fridays. But every club has decided to so the same thing, so you will have a lot of conflicts. 

I tried to always schedule Thursdays off to keep my sanity one day a week, but there are so many little events or Mondays off that you end up having to move another rehearsal to Thursday instead.
