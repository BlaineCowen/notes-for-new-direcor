We like to go visit the feeder school and put on some performances for them for Christmas. We used to go with orchestra and take turns playing, but that got to be too hard to schedule. It was also always tradition to go to the Galleria to perform quickly and hang out for a few hours after, but it was always a pain to get that coordinated with them as well.

Last year I also did run outs with Red Rhythm. We won a grant a couple years ago that got us some good audio equipment so we could mic them up on the go. I would get the kids out of class a couple Fridays in December and have them perform at Miller, Queens and SHI.
