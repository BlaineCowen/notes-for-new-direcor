Red Rhythm is our auditioned show choir. They used to do 2-3 songs at every concert. However when it became a one director job, I cut them from the Fall Concert. I would think about cutting them from Winter as well and just have them focus on teaching them one great set to work on throughout the year and take them to the show choir invitational in Keller, Texas. We went last year just to watch and the kids loved it.

I've always kept it as a choir only group, but with numbers being so low, you may want to make it an open audition and try to draw kids from other parts of the school. 

I had an officer do most of the choreography for this group, but it may be too difficult for next years group to handle. If you need help with choreo, you may be able to try to contact Heidi Franco. She was a student here a few year ago, but she choreographed our entire musical with another alumni, Tomas Meza and did a very good job in my opinion. 

These students wear their sparkly red dresses or vests for performances.
