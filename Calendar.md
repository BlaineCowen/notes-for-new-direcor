Unfortunately I got locked out of my google account, so I can't find an example calendar. But the big dates are:
- all-state stuff (you know)
- Fall Concert – Early to mid october
- Winter concert – mid December
- Winter tour – Mid December
- Pre-UIL – Late Feb/Early March
- Solo and Ensemble Mid Feb
- UIL – end of March
- Pop Show – Thursday Friday in May

There also wasn't a calendar meeting this year, so I didn't get to reserve anything. I would get with the department head, Charlie Stott to see if you can reserve some dates for the auditorium ASAP.

They usually have a shared google calendar that you just add the dates to so there are no conflicts. However you will also have to email that calendar to Mrs. Alanis to add it to the school calendar (idk why she can't just look at the Fine Arts calendar).
