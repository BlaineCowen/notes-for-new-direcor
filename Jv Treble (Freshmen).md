-  This class has been almost twice as long as the others because of "activity time". Not sure if they will continue next year or not. It's an extra 30 minutes of time we are supposed to mentor the students or something, but I usually just continued rehearsal and let them have a break for the last 5-10 minutes instead. They never seemed to mind. They combine with 6th and 7th at concerts and uil to perform as a non-var treble choir. I will have vars treble join them for one song at the [[Fall Concert]] just to get their confidence up. If you pick something from middle school region 3 years ago, most of vars will already know it, so you won't have to spend much time teaching. This could also double as your lvl 3 piece for [[UIL]]
- They usually come in horrible at sight-reading. You have to start very very very basicâ€“like elementary level for a few weeks to make sure the have fundamentals. Eventually they can move to smart books and sing them individually.
