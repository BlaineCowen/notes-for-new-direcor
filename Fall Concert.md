I keep things basic for Fall and just do a few songs with Mixed, a combined guys piece, combined girls, and a couple JV treble songs. I started teaching one UIL piece per choir as well and performed them at the Fall Concert. I try to schedule Miller and South Houston to bring their top group and do a combined number at the end. They sometimes have trouble finding a date for their concerts, so they are usually happy to join. It's also probably a good idea to teach one ensemble number from the year's musical since it will be fun and introduce them to musical theater style. 

Clay Howell will probably be happy to accompany for free although I always paid him like $100 because it hurts other pianists if people play for free. He's a great pianist, just not he best reader, so make sure you get him the music ahead of time. I'm happy to accompany any time if you need someone, but it might be best to give you some time with the kids for a few years.

I have also always wanted to do Pop Show as my fall concert and a masterwork in May as the final concert. I didn't get to do it this year since there was so much work going on in the auditorium. It might be a good idea since it starts the year off fun and you get Pop Show out of the way.
