# Intro

Congratulations on getting the job as SoHo's new Choir director. I hope you have a great time teaching these wonderful students and bring the program major success. There are a lot of things I would like to let you know in case you would like to have a point of reference or to point to if students pull the "That's not the way Cowen did it" card. Feel free to disregard any of this and run the program how you see fit. I will not take any offense.

The kids might be pretty attached to me and put up barriers at first, but I'm sure you'll win them over in time. They promised me they would trust you and give you their best effort. 

I am not a very organized person, and I was left with quite a mess when I took over, so I didn't leave everything in as good of a condition as I would have preferred, but I promise you we tried! I'm a very laid back person, so the students will probably say that I was "chill", but I am not like that during class time. I always taught bell to bell and pushed them to be their best during class. They will try to get away with not standing, not trying, coming into class late, playing on their phones to test you and try to say I was fine with that. It shouldn't matter anyways, but I can assure you I wasn't. They can meet high expectations if you hold them to it. 

## Classes

The classes are set up strangely due to the logistics of Early college. It is an unfortunate reality of SHHS that we have to plan so much around ECHS. 

- [[1st Varsity Mixed Choir]]
- 2nd [[Tenor-Bass Choir]]
- 3rd Travel
	- Can travel to SHI, Miller, and Queens if your classes align. It's good to check in on them, but it's hard to find the time during concert seasons
- 4th Conference/Lunch
- 5th [[Jv Treble (Freshmen)]]
- 6th Jv Treble (New to choir treble)
- 7th Jv Treble (non-Freshmen)
- [[Red Rhythm]]

# General Class Overview

I kept things pretty basic then teaching–warm-ups, sight-reading, rep–every day. Sometimes I would do something more fun on Fridays, but there wasn't always time for that. I teach off my ipad and cast my music to the board using the apple tv. I really recommend doing this if you've never tried it. It makes sure students are looking at the right spot and can see updated notes you've made. If you use forscore, you can add an accompaniment track and slow it down, change keys, loop, etc. so it makes your job a lot easier. It also saves on paper which is a scarce resource here sometimes. 

Speaking of paper, I usually use the copy machine in the orchestra/band room since it is close than the other ones. Mr Horton should be able to get you paper if there isn't any in there.

## Fundraising

We've had success with World's Finest Chocolates in the past. I also used to go to Sam's club, buy $300 worth if rice krispys and have the kids sell them for like $2 a piece. That was also successful just time consuming. 

## Student Officers

I didn't choose student officers before I left because I had them chosen for me before I arrived, and it did not go very well with out choir president. So I wanted to give you the option to do interviews and choose on your own. I will leave you some recommendations.

President–Kevin Morales
Vice President (usually a junior)–Averie LaSalle
Uniform Manager–Alex Garza, Agustin Aguilar

and other great students to give leadership positions:
Camilla Rebolloso, Kimberly Negrette, Alexis Rangel, Benito Cadena.

I usually have a Librarian, Social Media Liason, and some other made up position.

I also choose section Leaders for Varsity. They are in charge of getting the music for each section and coming to you if they notice any issues that you don't notice. 

# Apps

We just moved from Charms to Cuttime this year. I transferred over everything that I could, but I may have missed a few things. 

I started using Band app last year to post updates, pictures and communicate with students last year. It works great, but it is blocked on the school wifi now. You would have to place a tech work order and hope they are able to fix it. 

I think they are moving from Remind to ParentSquare next year. That may be a more consistent way to communicate with parents and students together. 

I put any files I need the students to see in a shared google drive that I make them save. 

I've tried for a long time to get kids to use SmartMusic, but they hate it so much. It has a lot of good feature but a lot of very dumb bugs that make it not very useful in my opinion. 

I'll send a google doc with all of the passwords as soon as I can get back into my account/

# Uniforms

We just got new uniforms in like less than a months ago, so we spent a lot of time unloading the old ones and logging and hanging the news ones. We never finished getting rid of the old ones, so they are in bags in the "wood room" sorry! They told us to give any we aren't using to band, but they did not want them. We share uniforms with orchestra, which is fine except Cuttime won't let you have a shared uniform list. I instead made a Google sheets that I shared with the orchestra director so we could both see what uniforms we should have remaining. 

Red rhythm students use the sparkly dresses and vests. I had a lot of students lose the vests or the dry cleaner lost them. I'm not sure which it was, but you may want to talk to Holt about ordering some new ones. I usually get everything dry cleaned over the summer or in August so they are ready for Fall. I take the dresses to a laundromat down the road and wash them on my own and the dry cleaning needs to go to New Queen Oaks Cleaners on Strawberry. (They suck but will deliver them to you whenever they are done at least).

# Last Thoughts

That's all I can think to leave you with. I hope it's enough the get you through the year smoothly. It gets a lot easier after your first year here. LIke I said, feel free to call or text me with any question throughout the year. You always have little things that come up like the Dynamo needing a last minute national anthem performance, or Sally Schott wanting to throw an alumni party and have the choir perform, or the admin asking for someone to perform last minute at the faculty meeting so always have something prepared. I was told to always say yes to everything if they asked, but I promise you can say no. I wish David, the band director would learn that word. He always makes us look bad. 

Anyways best of luck. I'm sure you will be fantastic!
