- Large class 40-50 students
- Some are pretty talented, all-state material. Others are still learning. I prefer to have a large group with a few leaders in each section to pull others up rather than focus on only the strong ones. There simply aren't enough of those to create a consistent blend. You may have other opinions and could move people out of this class. One option would be to move the tenors and basses all to 2nd period. However, you would lose a few Early College kids who can only be in 1st period choir. 
- Class starts at 7:15 which is early, but they will get used to it. 
- These students are required to perform the National Anthem at every [[home football games]] and do 2 of the following 3 events: All-State Choir, the [[Musical]], or Solo and Ensemble. They are also required to attend at least 1 [[After School Rehearsal]] a week. 
- For [[UIL]], I take them as a mixed choir but also take the trebles as a separate Varsity Treble choir, and the guys plus 2nd period as a varsity Tenor-Bass Choir. I've had success (2/3 sweepstakes) doing this when choosing the easiest possible [[repetoire]] and beginning it early. Last year I knew it would be my last and selfishly chose harder music and missed out on sweepstakes, but I think they are better this year because of it. 
- I usually use a mix of Sight Reading Factory and Smart Books with themâ€“trying to get to the purple smart books as soon as possible before starting the octavos.
