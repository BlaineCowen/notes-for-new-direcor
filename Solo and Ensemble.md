In years past I would sign up all of my best students and "make" them do Solo and Ensemble, but I would always have kids not show up, not pay, not be prepared, and it was just a waste of time. This past year I just told kids to pay their fee when it was due, and if they gave me money I signed them up and played for them. I only had like 12 kids go, but all of them got 1s and it was a much better experience for everyone.
